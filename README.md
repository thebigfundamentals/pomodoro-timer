# Pomodoro Timer

Pomodoro Timer made in React, without hooks or external libraries - except Bootstrap for design (and Howler for sound effects)

## TODO:
- Refactor the code
- Add sounds to alert the end of rounds / cycles ðŸ†—

## Small update 19.10.21
- Now the document title changes to the remaining time when the timer is running
- Code needs a lot of refactoring, but it will be done sometime in the future :)
